Error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'MvcMovieContext'
could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?) (CS0246) (MvcMovie)

When navigating to the file, there were red lines under MvcMovie, after clicking on the potential fixes button,
it recommended that I add a using state for MvcMovie.Data and that has removed the error

I encountered similar errors in other files, by adding the "using MvcMovie.data" to each file, the errors went away
